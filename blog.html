        <p class="title">Does using relative units matter?</p>
        <article>
            <p>A relative unit gets sizing from something else. In the specification the relative length units are defined as em, ex, ch and rem.These are font-relative lengths. The specification also defines a % value, which is always relative to another value.
               Using relative values means that things can scale up and down according to some other value.
            </p>
            <p>
                It really does matter to use relative units if we want to create a flexible and scalable design. We can make our design fit as the size of the screen changes by easily ajusting its size relative to the root.
                The relative units have differnet properties. As a matter of fact one can get easily confused on how to make the adjustment and the calculation even about which unit to use.
                In this case, it is necessary to pay attention to which element the calculation refers to correspondingly, for example, to the immediately superior element, or to the visible surface of the screen (Viewport). 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand browsers having a zooming feature is also an easy option in which browsers take the control away from developers interms of creating their own layout.
                Users can go to settings and change both the font size and increase/decrease the zooming of the page. But as users keep changing the font-size ang zooming, they might not
                get the desired output if the webpage is completely dependent on the zoomign feature of the browser. The webpage can be subjected to blurred vision. So, after an argument with
                myself and reading this amazing website; <a href="https://www.24a11y.com/2019/pixels-vs-relative-units-in-css-why-its-still-a-big-deal/">pixels vs. relative units</a>, which explains this agrument with reliable source and 
                examples i was convinced that flexibility(relative units) being add  can create an even more comfortable reading experience when zoomed.

        <p class="title">The browser's default size(16px) and how it interprets other sizes</p>
        <article>
            <p>It is true that the browser has its default size set to 16px but this doesnt mean that one can not set a size any larger than its defaul size. Infact it means that when ever an individual doesnt set a width value, 
                the browser's default value will be set to that specific element. We can scale up the size of our element up to 1366px and higher nowadays.  
                Sometimes, if we set the the size of the body of the page to 16px, we should note that the other elements will attain to a relative size. </p>

        <p class="title">What is new in CSS3?</p>
        <article>
            <p>CSS3 does not deprecate older CSS code because it is only an addition to the features offered by CSS1. CSS3 version introduced new features that allowed developers to style HTML elements with less CSS code. CSS3 is most notorious 
               for modules that speed up the specification process.</p>
            <p class="title2">Over View of the new features</p> 
            <p class="title3">Box Shadow</p>
            <p>One of the CSS3 new features is the box-shadow property that adds a shadow to an element. Instead of using multiple images around an item, this property lets us add shadow with a short line of code.</p>
            <p class="title3">Opacity</p>
            <p>One of the CSS3 properties called opacity makes elements see-through or completely transparent. For instance, we can apply opacity o images or other HTML elements. The transparency level depends on the indicated values. </p>
            <p class="title3">Rounded Corners</p>
            <p>Before the release of CSS3, developers had to write long code to produce rounded corners. Now, it is enough to apply the border-radius  CSS3 property to HTML elements.</p>
            <p class="title3">Attribute Selectors</p>
            <p>CSS3 also introduced new selectors in addition to the ones in CSS2. Instead of applying IDs or classes for styling, developers can select HTML elements according to their attributes.
               As a result, we do not have to create unique IDs only to apply CSS rules.</p>
            <p class="title3">New Colors</p>
            <p>One of the CSS3 features is the addition of new colors: RGBA, HSL, HSLA, Gradient Colors.</p>
            <p class="title3">More unique Fonts</p>
            <p>Instead of only using fonts labeled as web-safe, developers now can apply more unique fonts in their HTML documents. Before that, CSS wanted to ensure that all browsers and machines display fonts the same.</p>
